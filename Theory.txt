Virtual DOM -> a tree structure created by React which is a copy of actual DOM.
React dont use it extensively anymore.
React uses diff one tree with another to determine which parts of DOM need to be changed. (reconciliation).

React Fiber -> its a "reimplmentation" of Virtual DOM.
instead of updating DOM in a single step it now updates it in chunks.
this algorithm gives you ability to Pause, Abort, Reuse work and also to assign priority to different types of updates.
that is the reason sometimes we get buttons first but they are not functional for few seconds then Javascript is injected into those components. (Hydration)
instead of changing every small change it changes a chunk of change at once in the virtual DOM. (concurrency).
"keys" are useful in lists for rendering fast and improve performance of "React Fibre". keys should be Stable, Predictable and unique.
